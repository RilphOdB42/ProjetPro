On  va utiliser la trilatération pour connaître la position GPS du capteur.
Les satellites vont envoyer des informations au capteur GPS et le capteur va ensuite traiter ces informations pour en déduire sa position. 
Les informations vont aller sur un LCD (  afficheur à cristal liquide) qui va transmettre les données de position à l'utilisateur.  



To define a position in space, three coordinates (x, y and z) are required. GPS data also includes a fourth variable: time. It requires four satellites equipped with atomic clocks to obtain a position, and a GPS receiver that will decode and calculate the signals received. .
The operating principle of the system is based on triangulation.
 A satellite emits an electromagnetic wave of known speed. This wave, carrying a "pseudo-random" code, is transmitted at a definite time. The receiver then calculates the transmission time, the time required for its signal to be in phase with the signal emitted by the satellite. By multiplying this time by the speed, it thus obtains the distance which separates it from the satellite.
The receiver has a first information: it is on a circle centered on the satellite. By repeating this procedure with a second satellite, it can again be located on a second circle centered on the second satellite. Repeating the operation a third time and looking for the area of ??intersection between these three circles, we obtain the position on the Earth. The fourth satellite makes it possible to determine the time difference between the time of the GPS receiver and the exact time provided by the satellites, in order to refine the position. The higher the number of satellites captured, the better the accuracy.
But for this project we will use 3 satellites.
